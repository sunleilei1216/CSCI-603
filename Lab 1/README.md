# Lab 1
## Problem
Using Pythonâ€™s turtle graphics module, design the typography for, and implement a program that uses it to draw your family name, as shown below.

_You may choose to follow the above design, or you may design your own font._

## Implementation
Each student will individually implement and submit their own solution to the problem as a Python program named __myname.py__.

You will render your own family name, or a prefix or superset of it. The restriction is that the name string you choose must have the following properties:
- It uses at least 6 different characters (not including a space).
- It repeats at least 1 character.

If your original name uses non-Latin characters and can still follow the above properties, you are encouraged to program it that way!

### Formula Calculations
If the letters you need include lines written on a diagonal, you will require mathematical functions, e.g. roots, trigonometry. Include `import math` at the top of your program file. To find the name of the math function you need, search the library documentation for the Python math module.

### Program Operation
When run, the program should execute `turtle.mainloop()` after drawing the figure so that the user can see the drawing before it terminates.
